## publishing (netlify)

1. Create a [Netlify Account](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Create a github repository using [The github UI](https://github.com) OR [The github CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)

### UI

After creating the repo (as you usually do) run

```bash
git init # if you havent already
git remote add origin github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
git add .
git commit -am "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

### CLI

```bash
git init # if you havent already
gh repo create # this will ask the repo name and if you want to add remote.
git add .
git commit -am "Inition commit"
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

3. Add your repo to netlify. If you have created your account you should be able to login to the [Netlify Console](https://app.netlify.com), here you can create your team and link github account, after doing so create the app from your github repo
